In a Phase IV Canadian registry of children at high risk for RSV, the safety and tolerability of palivizumab was evaluated based on observations from 2008-2013. Under active surveillance, a small proportion of infants in the registry experienced serious adverse events that had a potential relationship with palivizumab. Palivizumab appears to be well-tolerated in high-risk children in routine practice.
